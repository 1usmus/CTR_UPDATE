2.1.6.13.
----------------
What's new?
----------------
* Frequency fluctuations during dynamic profile operation are significantly reduced (updated rules for dynamic profiles).  
* Improved prevention of frequency peaks in light load (overboost, which leads to crashing). 
User intervention in the OB settings for PX HIGH is welcome to achieve better performance or stability. 
If you encounter instability you can decrease the OB for PX HIGH (rarely for PX MID) by 18, try increasing the voltage for PX HIGH (1375 -> 1400, for example) 
or increase the CPU LLC level. 
* The profile holding settings have been changed. Profiles should not react to Windows thread manager stuttering.
* Adjusting CO (Curve Optimizer) calculation for Ryzen 9 5950X.
* Added basic support for AIDA64. Since this application does not use CPPC I cannot guarantee its stability.
* Changed presentation of CO (Curve Optimizer) information (each value has either a minus sign or none).
* Auto update does not want to work (fixed).
* The debug information will only be available if the "NOTIFICATION" option is enabled. It is recommended to use only to find compatibility problems in the system.
* Improved performance in some games and applications.
* Other minor fixes and stability improvements.
